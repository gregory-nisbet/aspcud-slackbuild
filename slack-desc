# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

aspcud: The aspcud project provides the converter/preprocessor cudf2lp to 
aspcud: translate a CUDF specification into a set of facts. These facts
aspcud: together with an encoding can then be passed to an ASP grounder and
aspcud: solver to solve the package problem. The small C program aspcud takes
aspcud: care of this, calling the necessary tools and printing the result in
aspcud: CUDF format.
